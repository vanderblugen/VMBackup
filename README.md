# VMBackup
This is two scripts used for backing up HyperV VMs
## [ExportVMBackup.ps1](https://github.com/vanderblugen/VMBackup/blob/main/ExportVMBackup.ps1)
This exports the VM to a specified folder and removes old ones
## [SnapshotAutomation](https://github.com/vanderblugen/VMBackup/blob/main/SnapshotAutomation.ps1)
This creates VM snapshots and removes old ones depending on how long ago they were created.
A portion of this was obtained from [here](https://www.logitblog.com/automated-hyper-v-vm-snapshots-with-powershell)
